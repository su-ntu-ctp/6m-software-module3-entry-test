Question 4:
Inheritance happens when a class inherits attributes and objects from another class.

In the question, create a child class called Student that gets attributes from a parent class called Person.

The Student class should have additional properties and methods:
Property:
- gradeLevel (String)

Method:
- study() - The study method takes in a string and should output: "I love studying <string>" ex. I love studying Algebra

You can use pseudocode or read through how Java does inheritance - [Link](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_inheritance.asp)

```java
class Person {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private int age;
}

//Modify this code
class Student {}
//End code
```
